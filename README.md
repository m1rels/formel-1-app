# Formel-1
This is a web application with which you can look up any data of the formula 1 seasons from 1950 to 2022.

You are able to look up any information of the drivers, constructors and the places where the races took place for a particular season.
I got the data from the Ergast Developer API http://ergast.com/mrd/.
